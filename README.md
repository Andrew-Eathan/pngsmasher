# pngsmasher.NET
pngsmasher is my original take on stylised image corruption!  
this is a rewrite of its predecessor, [pngf***er](https://github.com/andrew-eathan/pngfucker) which was written in NodeJS.  
pngsmasher is currently made out of:  
- pngsmasher.core, a dll library containing all of the standalone corruption functions that can be used on any RGBA buffer  
- pngsmasher.cli, a recreation of the pngf***er command line interface, featuring roughly the same functionality  
  
i'm kinda lazy, so if you want to see what pngsmasher can do, look at its [predecessor](https://github.com/andrew-eathan/pngfucker), which has a full wiki documenting every argument with examples!  
pngsmasher isn't complete, as it doesn't support animated corruption at all (unless i decide to work on it again)
